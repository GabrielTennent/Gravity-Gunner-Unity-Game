No aduio - Text explanation - read technology description first:

first moving with counter strafing - counter act momentum by moving in 
oppisite direction.

second moving without counter strafing - letting character slide

mix of both moving with control and without

when spamming between moving left and right to show 0 point in movement that
is recognised by the mechanic

towards the end I start flipping the gravity to show at the tips of the 
transition in gravity there is a point where the player has 0 velocity still 
though the player must also not be moving left and right which is also
shown.


## Technology description:

The technology I am covering in this assignment is the demonstration of one of
the movement mechanic's used in Counter Strike GO. The movement mechanic I am 
focusing on is Valve (counter stikes devolopers) implementation of what
I call ice movement. What this means is when the player stops holding down a 
movement key they still continue moving for a period after that, exactly
like taking your foot off the accelerator in the car. 

Though this mechanic is so simple and exists in many games, counter strike have
made movement control the most important mechanic in the game to learn. Movement
control meaning being able to counter the ice effect of moving by moving your 
character in the oppisite direction ever so slightly after letting go of the 
original direction to counter act the left over momentum and prevent sliding.
This prevention of sliding is very important because well sliding or moving
at all in the game the accuracy of your gun is very poor. Only becoming accurate
well standing still and will never become accurate if the first shot is made
well moving. So players that have proper movement control will have accurate 
shots faster than those who dont. This makes counter strike a very unique FPS
because even though aim is such a huge part of the game it dosn't matter if you
can't control your character properly as the movement and shooting have a 
relationship.

For my demonstration of this technology I have made a 2D example of the movement
mechanic in a exaggerated form. In my case the players continues sliding for 
a lot longer but this is for demonstration purposes. Well the player has a
decent amount of velocity the player is red, indicating that they are moving.
When the player comes to a dead stand still they turn green indicating they have
no velocity. This movement mechanic could be integrated with any mechanic in a 
game, meaning that for the given mechanic to work properly the player must first
control their character to a dead stand still. This increases the required
player input to progress through the game quickly and if implemented correctly
can make the game a lot more satisfying to learn.

Another variation of an interesting movement mechanic is seen in Apex legends,
where they integrate the three primary movement types for fastest possible 
movement. Making the fastest way to move in the game cycling through running, 
crouch -> sliding, and then jumping out. Though this is very different to the 
movement mechanic I have demonstrate, it is similar in the sense they are 
inegrating complex player inputs into a basic core player movement - 
in turn increasing the skill cap of the game.
